#bash learning pipping function 
the piping command is basically used for lets say you want to get specific keywords from a long list or number of files
for example lets say i want to check my src list and am looking for my bash from there all i type is 
ls -l /usr/bin | grep bash
* the ls is to show list
* the -l is the list all hidden

or lets say in my Desktop folder i want to search for test dump i can just say ls -l Desktop | grep tes i dont have to write the full test dump and it finds all files associated with that.
